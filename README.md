Introduction:

We introduce a solution that's built upon using YoloV7 object detection algorithm to detect the visual pollution scenarios. Our object detection algorithm detects the visual pollution through the provided dataset where we passed through some stages like data exploration , data cleaning, data preprocessing , augmentation , training , validation and testing stages to achieve mAP of 77.43% , recall 77.04% and 68.22% precision. Our solution allowed fast, accurate real-time detection of the visual pollution signs in the streets.
